- Joshua 
    - I think there should be an index page and show page for games so that players can see what games are set up to see if they would like to join that game

    - Need to create a method of listing all the players that sign up for this game through player_game model on the Game show page

    - Able to create a game now.  We were missing host id, 
        Date is showing up weird and time is not showing up at all. Able to create properly from rails console

    - Issue with Update, too tired to figure out why... 

    - Got CRD for game need "Update"


Agenda for Today
    - Edit/Update game working 
    - Solve Date and time (Jeff did it in seconds)
    - Validations 
        - Player count (If player count is met, can't add more people)
        - Age validation (Must be 18 to play)
        - Can't play if court is booked on date and time
    - Create an user (new, create, edit, update) DONE
    - Home, root page (link to sign in)
