- Joshua 
    - I think there should be an index page and show page for games so that players can see what games are set up to see if they would like to join that game

    - Need to create a method of listing all the players that sign up for this game through player_game model on the Game show page

    - Able to create a game now.  We were missing host id, 
        Date is showing up weird and time is not showing up at all. Able to create properly from rails console

    - Issue with Update, too tired to figure out why... 
    
    - Got CRD for game need "Update"
